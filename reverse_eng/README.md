# ACM Programming Club - October 27, 2021

Today we will be looking at a simple white-box encryption challenge!
The file 'wb_encr.py' takes a string from the user and checks it
against a 'secret' string obfuscated within the file.

# Task

We must discover the secret string! We could of course brute force it,
but the Earth may stop spinning by the time we figure that out...use
the file 'wb_decr.py' to write a "decryption" program to discover the
key

# Write Up

We should ALWAYS document our work - in and out of class - so today
we will be completing a simple write up while we complete this task

### Program Analysis - Functionality

1.
2.

### Program Analysis - String Location

secretBytes holds bytes XORed by 25. We need to get these back to the original
values and into characters

### Program Analysis - Exploitability



### Solution

"Secret string" : Spicy McChicken
